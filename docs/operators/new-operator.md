## `new` operator
We can use `new` operator to create an object.

```java
Test t = new Test();
```
**Note:** After creating an object, constructor will be executed to perform initialization of an object. Hence, constructor is not for creation of an object, it is for initialization of an object.

We have only `new` keyword, but not `delete` keyword, because destruction of useless objects is the responsibility of Garbage Collector (GC).

## [] operator

We can use this operator for declaring and creating arrays.

```java
int [] x = new int[10];
```
